# Symmetrical-Components
Learning Tool for Symmetrical Components

We are making a visual tool for learning a complicated electrical engineering concept.
The tool will consist of 3 vector arrows the start at the origin and end where the user places them.
The default placement will be vector A = length 1 @ 0 degrees, B = 1 @ 120 degrees, C = 1 @ 240 degrees.
The user may click and drag any vector head and place it at a desired location or use input boxes for precision.

The tool will calculate the Positive Sequence, Negative Sequence, and Zero Sequence magnitudes and angles for the A, B, & C vectors.
The tool will show these vectors in output screens.
